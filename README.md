A modified version of Aerial from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) by [@ajlkn](https://twitter.com/ajlkn?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).

This website is a single-page, single-screen responsive site built on HTML5 and CSS3 and hosted on GitHub pages which I'm using as a personal website and sort-of digital business card.
