# Personal Website
A modified version of Aerial from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) by [@ajlkn](https://twitter.com/ajlkn?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).

This website is a single-page, single-screen responsive site built on HTML5 and CSS3 and hosted on GitHub Pages. I am treating this website build as a sort-of digital business card with a quick summary of my experience and relevant links for people to connect with me.
